The Project:
The python modules has been built by version 2.7.10:
1. done , see send.py module attached file code, this is the message sender
2. done , see receive.py module attached file code, this is the listener for any message 
   For sub-sections, a python module named data_manager.py is used by the listener module
   2.1 done , using the select_invoices_by_quantity method in data_manager
   2.2 done , using the select_items_purchased method in data_manager
   2.3 Not implemented, not enough time to
   2.4 was done using the select_best_seller method in data_manager, but I have a problem implanting the entire sql query into the code.
       See a query that wanted to run correctly in sqlite3 but in the python code it does not reveal what is bothering it. See attached file best_sellers.sql
       The xml I did not manage to produce in the code, not enough time to
   2.5 sludge using the create_table method in data_manager, for loading the table belongs to 2.4 not completed because of the same reason that is written in the above section
  
 In general, all the preparation of the infrastructure took time, but I succeeded. There is a file (sites & instructions.txt) that contains general information about how to do this
